    Project initiated. There's a rough idea of what the new design and widgets will look like. Keeping the current layout is something to keep in mind. Before digitalizing the design, I would like to create hand drawn drafts first. <br><br>Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/dyzhao1011/CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign/blob/main/Rough%20Drafts/Home%20Page%20General%20Format.pdf">Home Page General Format</a> that displays sections of where content would go on the website. <br> Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/dyzhao1011/CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign/blob/main/Rough%20Drafts/Widget%20Redesign.pdf">Widget Redesign</a> <br> Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/dyzhao1011/CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign/blob/main/Rough%20Drafts/Home%20Page%20General%20Format.pdf">Complete Home Page Example</a> which is a rough draft of what the website would look like with the widgets in place and the footer. <br><br> Drafts by hand is completed.

   - Modification of the "Important Dates" icon to change from colors to icons, add a setting option where user can customize
   * Added a new widget called "Online Synchronous" which contains an online class, its meeting date and link
   + Added a settings option for Tools where users can customize
   - Added a "Back to Top" tab between main screen and footer where user can click and it will go to the top

Other widgets, except "Important Dates" won't recieve their own folder or file because they're designs won't be changed or is simple. The next steps is to create "Important Dates" widget folder.
