# CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign
## Summary
Blackboard is an application designed for students and instructors for their courses. It allows students to access assignments and resources, view grades, and keep up with the class. It allows instructors to assign homework, announce important dates, and provide feedback to students. The current CUNY Blackboard home page design is outdated hence, this project is to design and develop a new model of the UI to rearrange, remove, enhance, and simplify elements while maintaining the integral structure.

    Project initiated. There's a rough idea of what the new design and widgets will look like. Keeping the current layout is something to keep in mind. Before digitalizing the design, I would like to create hand drawn drafts first. <br><br>Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/dyzhao1011/CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign/blob/main/Rough%20Drafts/Home%20Page%20General%20Format.pdf">Home Page General Format</a> that displays sections of where content would go on the website. <br> Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/dyzhao1011/CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign/blob/main/Rough%20Drafts/Widget%20Redesign.pdf">Widget Redesign</a> <br> Uploaded <a href="https://github.com/dyzhao1011/CUNY-Blackboard-Web-Redesign/blob/main/Rough%20Drafts/Home%20Page%20General%20Format.pdf">Complete Home Page Example</a> which is a rough draft of what the website would look like with the widgets in place and the footer. <br><br> Drafts by hand is completed. The next step is to digitialize the draft. The designs aren't final and there are things that I potentially might change or add.

    For the digital drafts, Figma will be used. This process was much faster than anticipated as it was done swiftly. A complete home page example was produced and some features where changed along the way. These include:
    
   - Modification of the "Important Dates" icon to change from colors to icons, add a setting option where user can customize
   * Added a new widget called "Online Synchronous" which contains an online class, its meeting date and link
   + Added a settings option for Tools where users can customize
   - Added a "Back to Top" tab between main screen and footer where user can click and it will go to the top

Other widgets, except "Important Dates" won't recieve their own folder or file because they're designs won't be changed or is simple. The next steps is to create "Important Dates" Widget folder.

  <summary> Purpose </summary>
  Blackboard is a powerful tool for students and instructors to interact. The current UI has many displaced navigation tabs, excess information, and outdated widgets. Other CUNY applications such as CUNYfirst and Degreeworks have been updated and Blackboard would benefit from having one as well. The purpose of this project is to make the CUNY Blacbkboard home page easier for students and instructors to navigate through Blackboard. While this project mainly focuses on the home page, other pages are in consideration of a redesign. In addition, the simplicity and the structure of the current home page will be maintained.

  + Redesign the drop down menu near the profile
  - Redesign/rename/keep current widgets

  <summary> Idea & Thoughts on the Changes </summary>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Header Section</summary>
    CUNY's iconic blue color logo replaces the white one. Though it is harder to see, it provides more recognition to it. The voicer over in the current home screen is very hard to see. Replacing it with a white accessibility icon makes it much more apparent.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Navigation Section</summary>
    The current navigation tabs are "Tech Resources/Help", "City College", and "City College Library" are seldom used. Replacing them with the tabs from the drop down menu near the profile, which are "My Announcements", "Updates", and "My Grades", provides much more value and accessibility as they are the ones that students typically access. When there are updates to each on of these tabs, then a red icon with a number will show up on their top right hand side. Also, a "Go To.." tab is very convienet, which when hovered, displays a drop down menu of links to other CUNY applications such as CUNYFirst, Degreeworks, College Library, etc.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Announcements/Important Information</summary>
    This section is in between the navigation section and the widgets. The anncounements are rearranged and should be updated on a basis to provide more relevant information. The course registration information remains unchanged.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Widgets</summary>
    There are a ton of widgets that students rarely use. Some widgets are unneccessary and some can be incorporated into others. In this project, there are 2 types are widgets: main and secondary. Main widgets are the most important ones and will be default. Secondary widgets are non default and situational that can be added to the main screen to the users.  
    <details>
      <summary>My Courses</summary>
      This widget is the first main widget. It cannot be condensed because it is the main reason why students access Blackboard. The old default design displays old courses and the most recent ones are at the bottom. Although it can be customized, it is still repetitive. These problems can be fixed by grouping courses by semester and adding an option to switch between terms by clicking the arrow. There are 2 modes for the widget: student mode and instructor mode. They will be default for each respective group. The option to customize its appearance is kept as students can choose what information about the course is displayed. If they choose more than 2, then the widget design would change and a drop down arrow would appear to the left of the course name. 
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Online Bookstore</summary>
      This widget is the second main widget. The design for this widget will stay the same. However, when there are no books for the current semester, then this widget will be condensed and moved down. The "Tools" widget will take its place.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Important Dates</summary>
      This widget is the third main widget and can be condensed. This widget is mainly for students. The current Blackboard has a calendar elsewhere but making one as a widget is beneficial. Users can switch between months and there are two modes: course mode and institution mode. The course mode displays due dates, exam dates, completed assignments, etc. for all of the current semester and the institution mode displays holidays, start/end of semester, registration deadlines, etc. The functionality of the calendar will go as followed. As long as the mouse is hovered over the date, it will display the information on the bottom of the calendar. If the user clicks on a date, then the infomation will stay on the bottom and vice versa. If a date has multiple icons, then it will simply display them on the other sides of the date. Finally, there is a setting mode where users can add personal dates and switch between icons and color.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Student Resources, Tools, Online Synchronous</summary>
      The first two are main widgets and acts as resources to users. "Online Synchronous" is a brand new widget that users can add when they have an online class. It serves as a quick way to access course meeting links without the hassle of finding it.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Other Widgets</summary>
      As the project commences or if recieved recommendations, there may be other useful widgets to add.
    </details>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Footer</summary>
    A "Back to Top" button is useful when the webpage gets too long from the expanding of the widgets. This section is appropriate for tech help, support, and resources. It contains direct links that are previously inside "Tech Resources/Help", "City College", "City College Library" to make them more accessbile.
